[_spacestone_](https://spacestone.netlify.com) is a website with the following features:

- **Blazing fast loading thanks to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).** Get all the benefits of static websites with none of the limitations. Gatsby sites are fully functional React apps, so you can create high-quality, dynamic web apps, from blogs to ecommerce sites to user dashboards.

- **Customizability.** Within the "src" folder, all adaptable files to be made by the user are available. [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) files are included to further the customize the styling. One can even go further to possibly add in aesthetic javascript node packages to add visuals.

- **Hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).** Don't get me wrong, GitHub Pages offers great utility for first timers, but as I experienced more with web hosts, I needed something more reliable and easier to use. Netlify offers both web-based and command-line interfaces in order to adapt to an extremely easy and intuitive user interface dependent on the user.
