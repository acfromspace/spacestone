<i>spacestone</i> is an entry portal website with the following features:

- **Blazing fast loading thanks to Gatsby.** Get all the benefits of static websites with none of the
  limitations. Gatsby sites are fully functional React apps, so you can create high-quality,
  dynamic web apps, from blogs to ecommerce sites to user dashboards.

- **About section.** No matter where the data comes from, Gatsby sites   are built using React and GraphQL. Build a uniform workflow for you    and your team, regardless of whether the data is coming from the        same back-end.

- **Load Data From Anywhere.** Gatsby pulls in data from any data source, whether it‚Äôs Markdown
  files, a headless CMS like Contentful or WordPress, or a REST or GraphQL API. Use source plugins
  to load your data, then develop using Gatsby‚Äôs uniform GraphQL interface.

- **Performance Is Baked In.** Ace your performance audits by default. Gatsby automates code
  splitting, image optimization, inlining critical styles, lazy-loading and prefetching resources,
  and more to ensure your site is fast ‚Äî no manual tuning required.

- **Host at Scale for Pennies.** Gatsby sites don‚Äôt require servers, so you can host your entire
  site on a CDN for a fraction of the cost of a server-rendered site. Many Gatsby sites can be
  hosted entirely free on services like GitHub Pages and Netlify.

## üöÄ Get Up and Running in 5 Minutes

You can get a new Gatsby site up and running on your local dev environment in 5 minutes with these three steps:

1.  **Create a Gatsby site from a Gatsby starter.**

    Get your Gatsby blog set up in a single command:

    ```sh
    # install the Gatsby CLI globally
    npm install -g gatsby-cli

    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-blazing-fast-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default#v2
    ```

2.  **Start the site in `develop` mode.**

    Next, move into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up:

    ```sh
    cd my-blazing-fast-site/
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. Open the the `my-blazing-fast-site` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

At this point, you‚Äôve got a fully functional Gatsby website. For additional information on how you can customize your Gatsby site, see our [plugins](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) and [the official tutorial](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).

## üéì Learning Gatsby

Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/).

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples head [to our documentation](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the ‚ÄúGuides‚Äù, API reference, and ‚ÄúAdvanced Tutorials‚Äù sections in the sidebar.

We welcome suggestions for improving our docs. See the [‚Äúhow to contribute‚Äù](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute/) documentation for more details.

## Developer Notes

```
# Install the Gatsby CLI tool globally on your machine
npm install --global gatsby-cli

# Create a new "github.io" repo
(This will be in Github, create new repo YOUR_USERNAME.github.io)

# Initialize the repo in the space you want your workspace to be
(I use GitKraken (Git GUI), so I sign in to GitHub through GitKraken)

# Clone empty repo to desired workspace
(I usually clone repo to the desktop for easy access)

# Create TWO separate branches (IMPORTANT!)
(I do this in GitKraken) Make 1 branch master and leave it be, make another your dev-build area.

# Dev on the OTHER branch, not MASTER
(I also do this in GitKraken)

# Clone in the workspace in your favorite text editor
gatsby new SITE_NAME https://github.com/acfromspace/acfromspace.github.io

# Change directory to your SITE_NAME
cd SITE_NAME

# Update packages
npm update | yarn (sometimes need to manually install packages)

# Make sure to install gh-pages
npm install gh-pages --save-dev | yarn add --dev gh-pages

# Include script in the package.json file
"deploy": "gatsby build && gh-pages -d public -b master"

# To dev on your side
gatsby develop

# To deploy to github.io
npm run deploy | yarn deploy

# What now?
Enjoy deving!
```
