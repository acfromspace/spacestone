Well what do we have here?  
Congratulations you found the secret side of this website, you should feel proud.  
What am I going to put here? How about my poetry!  
Let's start with a soft one.

### whom?

> Roses are red,  
> Violets are blue,  
> Proper use is "to whom?",  
> Not "to who?".

Thank you for reading.
